       "u'Captain\\'s log, stardate 45944.1. We\\'re en route to Starbase Two-eighteen after a magnetic wave survey of the Parvenium Sector. We will give our report directly to Fleet Admiral Gustafson. The last time I encountered Admiral Gustafson... I ended up spending nine straight hours at the opera. The entire \"Ring\" cycle at one sitting... And for me... but not, apparently, for Admiral Gustafson. She went back the next day and sat through it all again. I warned her that this time -- On screen. Magnify. Mister Data? Increase power to -- Where is this... ? Computer, freeze program. (beat) End program. Picard to Enterprise -- I asked you... what is this place? Where is my uniform? My communicator? I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. I would like to speak with whoever is in charge here. Just tell me this -- am I a prisoner here? Are you in charge here? I want to be returned to my ship immediately. Please... if you could tell me... what is this place? Where am I? That must be it. Perhaps you could help me... My name is Kamin... and you are -- ? Ah. And you say I\\'ve been ill... Eline. And... what is this place? Please -- I\\'m sure it will come back to me... What planet? I\\'m really quite all right. If you\\'ll just answer... Kataan... not a Federation planet. I think I\\'ll take a walk... Exercise will do me good. I\\'d like to -- re-acquaint myself with the surroundings. Hungry, thirsty... weary... I suppose that proves this isn\\'t a dream, doesn\\'t it? It\\'s not my life... I know that much. I walked. For hours. This is delicious... Would you -- answer some questions for me? No matter how strange they might seem to you? Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit any other systems... ? All right. Is there any kind of communication system here? How do you send messages to... to other communities? Other places? Yes. When can that be arranged? Of course. Anything you can tell me would be helpful. We are... married? What is it that I do... here in Ressik? The flute? And when did I learn to play it? I see what you mean. Thank you for the soup. And for your help. Tomorrow will you help me send a message? I\\'ll sleep here... I\\'ve been sick... I may be tossing and turning... it wouldn\\'t be fair to you. Where did you get this? I\\'m just charting the sun\\'s movements. It might give some clues to the cause of this drought. The memory\\'s five years old now, but it\\'s still inside me. (shrugs) My other existence may be gone, but I still wonder about it. Eline... It was real... as real as this is. You can\\'t expect me to forget the lifetime I spent there... I know this has been hard for you... You have been amazingly tolerant. Good morning, Batai... Yes... (to Eline) Will you come along? It isn\\'t her fault. These last few years have been difficult for her. If the weather pattern doesn\\'t change, rationing won\\'t be enough. We will run out of water. No. I haven\\'t spoken to you before. I suggest we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the air. Iron weaving. (beat) And playing the flute. Each community would be responsible for its own. These condensers could mean the difference between watering our crops... or watching them die. We\\'ll never see an atmospheric condenser... Come to dinner tonight, my friend. I\\'ll make a vegetable stew. We\\'ll talk about building our own condenser. I\\'m not brooding. I\\'m immersed in my music. (re: flute) I\\'ve found it helps me think. (a smile) The real surprise is that I enjoy it so much. Goodnight, my friend. Yes, ma\\'am. I\\'m the one who\\'s sorry. (beat) Everything you said this morning was absolutely right. I\\'ve given you so little... and you have given me so much... tenderness, patience... and a good talking to when I needed it. (beat) You\\'ve been more than I could ever have hoped for. More than I deserve. Not such a wonderful husband. I spend my spare time charting the stars... I disappear for days at a time exploring the countryside... and I never put away my shoes. I lead my life very much as I did -- before. (quick glance at her) Old habits. I\\'d like to ask your permission to build something. In this case, I think I do. A nursery. Unless you\\'d rather have a porch. It\\'d certainly be easier to build... We name this child for a dear friend who died last year... but who will now live on through his namesake. He\\'s starting life in the warmth of friends. Thank you. (re: long table) Please, help yourselves to something to eat. I remember. I was so nervous I thought I might drop her. (beat) Now look at her... a little lady... (an admission) I\\'d always thought I didn\\'t need children to make my life complete... now, I can\\'t imagine life without them. Meribor... ? That\\'s my hobby; find your own. And what has the scientist been up to today? I haven\\'t reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn\\'t function by conjecture. (beat) Tell me... why don\\'t you spend more time with that young fellow Dannick? I\\'m not; I\\'m hypothesizing that he\\'s in love with you. Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns... games and toys and clothes... No... but it saddens me to see you bear the burden of knowing things... things you can\\'t change. But I\\'m not sixteen. With my life ahead of me. I can only say... (Beat) ... Live now, Meribor. Always make \"now\" the most precious time. \"Now\" will not come again. Ah. Thank you, dear. Fine. Then maybe you\\'ll sit down and rest the way you\\'re supposed to. He loves doing a lot of things -- too many. One week he wants to be a botanist, the next week a sculptor. I wish he could find some focus in his life. (calling) Batai? I get the feeling from your mother that you have something to tell me. Leaving school -- ? No, you\\'re not -- Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. A year before that it was botany. Now -- We\\'ll... we\\'ll discuss it. If music is what he wants... why should I stand in his way? (beat) Who knows how much time he\\'ll have to follow any dream. Yes. (beat) It\\'s possible he\\'ll dismiss me from the Council. The evidence is too pronounced. I can\\'t stay silent. (brandishing journal) The facts are here. At least show them to someone who will recognize what they mean. If you won\\'t take them, I most certainly will. Surely the technology exists to save something of this world... perhaps some people could be evacuated... A collection of genetic samples, then -- something, anything -- you can\\'t just let this civilization die -- What is it -- ? Doctor -- ? (in kind) You always had a flair for the dramatic... He didn\\'t have to. They already know. (small smile) No... I will. You shouldn\\'t be out there for so long. It\\'s damaging, you know that. Mmnph. (to Kamie) Do you wear your skin protector outdoors, young man? What \"launching\"? What\\'s he talking about? Are we, indeed. I\\'m not going anywhere to watch anything. (looking after them) Breaks my heart to look at him... My grandson. Breaks my heart... he deserves a full rich life, and he\\'s not going to get one. Why didn\\'t I hear anything about a launching? Did everyone know about this except me? I can see all right from here. You go on with the others. Go hold onto my grandson, and watch the damned thing go up... for all the good it\\'ll do. What is it they\\'re launching? Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven\\'t seen any missile. (in disbelief) Batai? A probe... that encounters someone... ... someone in the future... (realizing) ... it\\'s me, isn\\'t it? I\\'m the someone... I\\'m the one it finds... that\\'s what this launching is -- a probe that finds me... in the future... Eline... Eline... (very weak) What... How long? How long have I been... like this? (lost) Twenty-five minutes? Very well, Doctor. But as soon as you\\'re done... I have a great deal to tell you. Come. Yes, thank you... but I find I\\'m having to remind myself that this -- (gesturing) -- is really my home.'"
