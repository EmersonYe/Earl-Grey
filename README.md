Stats... the final frontier. These are the analyses of The Next Generation. My continuing mission, to explore strange new insights. To seek out new facts and new visualizations. To boldly go where no one has gone before.

Check out [distinguishing_words.ipynb](https://github.com/EmersonYe/Earl-Grey/blob/master/distinguishing_words.ipynb) first. The other files are either supporting files used by distinguishing_words.ipynb or exploratory files that I ended up not using for the final visualization.
