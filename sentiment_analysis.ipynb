       "u'Captain\\'s log, stardate 45944.1. We\\'re en route to Starbase Two-eighteen after a magnetic wave survey of the Parvenium Sector. We will give our report directly to Fleet Admiral Gustafson. The last time I encountered Admiral Gustafson... I ended up spending nine straight hours at the opera. The entire \"Ring\" cycle at one sitting... And for me... but not, apparently, for Admiral Gustafson. She went back the next day and sat through it all again. I warned her that this time -- On screen. Magnify. Mister Data? Increase power to -- Where is this... ? Computer, freeze program. (beat) End program. Picard to Enterprise -- I asked you... what is this place? Where is my uniform? My communicator? I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. I would like to speak with whoever is in charge here. Just tell me this -- am I a prisoner here? Are you in charge here? I want to be returned to my ship immediately. Please... if you could tell me... what is this place? Where am I? That must be it. Perhaps you could help me... My name is Kamin... and you are -- ? Ah. And you say I\\'ve been ill... Eline. And... what is this place? Please -- I\\'m sure it will come back to me... What planet? I\\'m really quite all right. If you\\'ll just answer... Kataan... not a Federation planet. I think I\\'ll take a walk... Exercise will do me good. I\\'d like to -- re-acquaint myself with the surroundings. Hungry, thirsty... weary... I suppose that proves this isn\\'t a dream, doesn\\'t it? It\\'s not my life... I know that much. I walked. For hours. This is delicious... Would you -- answer some questions for me? No matter how strange they might seem to you? Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit any other systems... ? All right. Is there any kind of communication system here? How do you send messages to... to other communities? Other places? Yes. When can that be arranged? Of course. Anything you can tell me would be helpful. We are... married? What is it that I do... here in Ressik? The flute? And when did I learn to play it? I see what you mean. Thank you for the soup. And for your help. Tomorrow will you help me send a message? I\\'ll sleep here... I\\'ve been sick... I may be tossing and turning... it wouldn\\'t be fair to you. Where did you get this? I\\'m just charting the sun\\'s movements. It might give some clues to the cause of this drought. The memory\\'s five years old now, but it\\'s still inside me. (shrugs) My other existence may be gone, but I still wonder about it. Eline... It was real... as real as this is. You can\\'t expect me to forget the lifetime I spent there... I know this has been hard for you... You have been amazingly tolerant. Good morning, Batai... Yes... (to Eline) Will you come along? It isn\\'t her fault. These last few years have been difficult for her. If the weather pattern doesn\\'t change, rationing won\\'t be enough. We will run out of water. No. I haven\\'t spoken to you before. I suggest we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the air. Iron weaving. (beat) And playing the flute. Each community would be responsible for its own. These condensers could mean the difference between watering our crops... or watching them die. We\\'ll never see an atmospheric condenser... Come to dinner tonight, my friend. I\\'ll make a vegetable stew. We\\'ll talk about building our own condenser. I\\'m not brooding. I\\'m immersed in my music. (re: flute) I\\'ve found it helps me think. (a smile) The real surprise is that I enjoy it so much. Goodnight, my friend. Yes, ma\\'am. I\\'m the one who\\'s sorry. (beat) Everything you said this morning was absolutely right. I\\'ve given you so little... and you have given me so much... tenderness, patience... and a good talking to when I needed it. (beat) You\\'ve been more than I could ever have hoped for. More than I deserve. Not such a wonderful husband. I spend my spare time charting the stars... I disappear for days at a time exploring the countryside... and I never put away my shoes. I lead my life very much as I did -- before. (quick glance at her) Old habits. I\\'d like to ask your permission to build something. In this case, I think I do. A nursery. Unless you\\'d rather have a porch. It\\'d certainly be easier to build... We name this child for a dear friend who died last year... but who will now live on through his namesake. He\\'s starting life in the warmth of friends. Thank you. (re: long table) Please, help yourselves to something to eat. I remember. I was so nervous I thought I might drop her. (beat) Now look at her... a little lady... (an admission) I\\'d always thought I didn\\'t need children to make my life complete... now, I can\\'t imagine life without them. Meribor... ? That\\'s my hobby; find your own. And what has the scientist been up to today? I haven\\'t reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn\\'t function by conjecture. (beat) Tell me... why don\\'t you spend more time with that young fellow Dannick? I\\'m not; I\\'m hypothesizing that he\\'s in love with you. Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns... games and toys and clothes... No... but it saddens me to see you bear the burden of knowing things... things you can\\'t change. But I\\'m not sixteen. With my life ahead of me. I can only say... (Beat) ... Live now, Meribor. Always make \"now\" the most precious time. \"Now\" will not come again. Ah. Thank you, dear. Fine. Then maybe you\\'ll sit down and rest the way you\\'re supposed to. He loves doing a lot of things -- too many. One week he wants to be a botanist, the next week a sculptor. I wish he could find some focus in his life. (calling) Batai? I get the feeling from your mother that you have something to tell me. Leaving school -- ? No, you\\'re not -- Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. A year before that it was botany. Now -- We\\'ll... we\\'ll discuss it. If music is what he wants... why should I stand in his way? (beat) Who knows how much time he\\'ll have to follow any dream. Yes. (beat) It\\'s possible he\\'ll dismiss me from the Council. The evidence is too pronounced. I can\\'t stay silent. (brandishing journal) The facts are here. At least show them to someone who will recognize what they mean. If you won\\'t take them, I most certainly will. Surely the technology exists to save something of this world... perhaps some people could be evacuated... A collection of genetic samples, then -- something, anything -- you can\\'t just let this civilization die -- What is it -- ? Doctor -- ? (in kind) You always had a flair for the dramatic... He didn\\'t have to. They already know. (small smile) No... I will. You shouldn\\'t be out there for so long. It\\'s damaging, you know that. Mmnph. (to Kamie) Do you wear your skin protector outdoors, young man? What \"launching\"? What\\'s he talking about? Are we, indeed. I\\'m not going anywhere to watch anything. (looking after them) Breaks my heart to look at him... My grandson. Breaks my heart... he deserves a full rich life, and he\\'s not going to get one. Why didn\\'t I hear anything about a launching? Did everyone know about this except me? I can see all right from here. You go on with the others. Go hold onto my grandson, and watch the damned thing go up... for all the good it\\'ll do. What is it they\\'re launching? Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven\\'t seen any missile. (in disbelief) Batai? A probe... that encounters someone... ... someone in the future... (realizing) ... it\\'s me, isn\\'t it? I\\'m the someone... I\\'m the one it finds... that\\'s what this launching is -- a probe that finds me... in the future... Eline... Eline... (very weak) What... How long? How long have I been... like this? (lost) Twenty-five minutes? Very well, Doctor. But as soon as you\\'re done... I have a great deal to tell you. Come. Yes, thank you... but I find I\\'m having to remind myself that this -- (gesturing) -- is really my home.'"

We will give our report directly to Fleet Admiral Gustafson.  4    INT. BRIDGE  PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, and GEORDI at their positions; N.D.\\'s as necessary. There is a light-hearted mood on the bridge.  The last time I encountered Admiral Gustafson... I ended up spending nine straight hours at the opera.  The entire \"Ring\" cycle at one sitting...  And for me... but not, apparently, for Admiral Gustafson. She went back the next day and sat through it all again. I warned her that this time --  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - 3/24/92 - TEASER       2.  4    CONTINUED:  On screen.  5    ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)  An alien object of unusual shape can be seen, though still at quite a distance. Picard moves toward the screen, between t conn and ops.  Magnify.  The object springs into greater relief. It is strange, and somehow foreboding.  Mister Data?  Increase power to --  Suddenly Picard staggers backward, as though struck. He sags, losing consciousness. Riker is already rushing to him as he begins falling.  Where is this... ?  A frown of concern on the woman\\'s face.  Computer, freeze program. (beat) End program.  Nothing. The woman keeps moving, trying to blot his forehead. He gets to his feet, automatically reaching for his communicator.  Picard to Enterprise --  But there is nothing there to hit. He looks down at his garb -- strange and alien.  I asked you... what is this place?  Her look is of loving concern.  Where is my uniform? My communicator?  She looks truly worried.  I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. I would like to speak with whoever is in charge here.  Just tell me this -- am I a prisoner here?  Her eyes widen in alarm.  Are you in charge here?  Batai is a bit taken aback by the brusque question.  I want to be returned to my ship immediately.  The group has a reaction to this... exchanging curious glances. Batai moves closer to Picard.  Please... if you could tell me... what is this place? Where am I?  That must be it. Perhaps you could help me...  My name is Kamin... and you are -- ?  Ah. And you say I\\'ve been ill...  Eline.  And... what is this place?  Batai becomes wary again, alarmed by his friend\\'s total memory loss.  Please -- I\\'m sure it will come back to me...  What planet?  Batai appears mystified, then comes toward Picard, puts an arm around his shoulder.  I\\'m really quite all right. If you\\'ll just answer...  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE    9.  14   CONTINUED: (3)  Kataan... not a Federation planet.  Batai looks at him, puzzled. Picard gives the group a reassuring smile.  I think I\\'ll take a walk...  A hesitation.  Exercise will do me good. I\\'d like to -- re-acquaint myself with the surroundings.  He gives a nod, then begins to stride purposefully out of the square. Batai stares after him, as do the mystified townspeople.  15 thru\\tOMITTED 16  16A  EXT. FIELDS - DAY  Picard roams the hills beyond the town, searching for clues to his mysterious abduction. He climbs a small ridge, stares off in the distance, then climbs down and proceeds on his way.  17   OMITTED  18   INT. KAMIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT  Eline sits at a small table, idly stirring soup in a bowl, when she hears something outside. She jumps up, goes to the door, activates it. Picard is standing there, bone-weary.  Hungry, thirsty... weary... I suppose that proves this isn\\'t a dream, doesn\\'t it?  She stands, stunned, staring at him.  It\\'s not my life... I know that much.  Stricken, she blinks away tears, turns to get food.  I walked. For hours.  He begins eating the soup.  This is delicious...  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE   11.  18   CONTINUED: (2)  Would you -- answer some questions for me? No matter how strange they might seem to you?  Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit any other systems... ?  Shocked, she literally just gapes at him. He reads her response.  All right. Is there any kind of communication system here? How do you send messages to... to other communities? Other places?  Yes. When can that be arranged?  Of course. Anything you can tell me would be helpful. We are... married?  She nods, clearly in pain that he has no recollection of this.  What is it that I do... here in Ressik?  The flute?  She rises, goes to a nearby shelf (or whatever) and brings to him. It is a device much like a penny-whistle. He holds it, turning it over in his hands; it is completely unfamiliar.  And when did I learn to play it?  I see what you mean.  He sets the flute down, rises.  Thank you for the soup. And for your help. Tomorrow will you help me send a message?  She smiles as though indulging a child. She has him back... he isn\\'t saying strange things anymore. It\\'s enough for now.  I\\'ll sleep here...  I\\'ve been sick... I may be tossing and turning... it wouldn\\'t be fair to you.  Where did you get this?  21   RESUME - SHOT  I\\'m just charting the sun\\'s movements. It might give some clues to the cause of this drought.  The memory\\'s five years old now, but it\\'s still inside me. (shrugs) My other existence may be gone, but I still wonder about it.  She regards him solemnly, then begins idly circling the courtyard... breaking off a dead flower or branch now and then. The garden has deteriorated; what were once abundant blooms are now small sickly plants without blossoms.  Eline...  It was real... as real as this is. You can\\'t expect me to forget the lifetime I spent there...  I know this has been hard for you...  You have been amazingly tolerant.  Good morning, Batai...  But Eline is strangely silent.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT TWO   22.  29   CONTINUED: (3)  Yes... (to Eline) Will you come along?  It isn\\'t her fault. These last few years have been difficult for her.  Batai gives him a glance.  If the weather pattern doesn\\'t change, rationing won\\'t be enough. We will run out of water.  The Administrator looks at Picard in some surprise.  No. I haven\\'t spoken to you before.  The Administrator smiles, acknowledging a new constituent.  I suggest we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the air.  The Administrator chuckles a little... condescending. He\\'s very charming... but gives nothing.  Iron weaving. (beat) And playing the flute.  The Administrator looks sharply at him... not sure if he\\'s being tweaked -- which he is. But Picard is straight-faced.  Each community would be responsible for its own. These condensers could mean the difference between watering our crops... or watching them die.  The Administrator is too experienced to get into a wrangle. He smiles and agrees -- an effective stonewalling.  We\\'ll never see an atmospheric condenser...  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - 3/24/92 - ACT TWO     26A.  30   CONTINUED: (4)  Come to dinner tonight, my friend. I\\'ll make a vegetable stew. We\\'ll talk about building our own condenser.  Batai nods, acquiescing. As Picard starts to turn away --  I\\'m not brooding. I\\'m immersed in my music.  (re: flute) I\\'ve found it helps me think. (a smile) The real surprise is that I enjoy it so much.  Goodnight, my friend.  Yes, ma\\'am.  She gives him a sidelong glance... sees the humor in him, and smiles back.  I\\'m the one who\\'s sorry. (beat) Everything you said this morning was absolutely right.  She stares at him, surprised.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT TWO   27A.  34   CONTINUED:  I\\'ve given you so little... and you have given me so much... tenderness, patience... and a good talking to when I needed it. (beat) You\\'ve been more than I could ever have hoped for. More than I deserve.  Hearing these unaccustomed and longed-for words, Eline hastens to reassure him.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT TWO   28.  34   CONTINUED: (2)  Not such a wonderful husband.  He puts his arm around her, musing.  I spend my spare time charting the stars... I disappear for days at a time exploring the countryside... and I never put away my shoes. I lead my life very much as I did -- before. (quick glance at her) Old habits.  I\\'d like to ask your permission to build something.  In this case, I think I do.  A nursery.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT TWO   29.  34   CONTINUED: (3)  Beat -- as she digests the enormity of this. Then, absolutely beaming, she wraps her arms around him.  Unless you\\'d rather have a porch. It\\'d certainly be easier to build...  She laughs, flinging her arms around him; he smiles. Then, tenderly, lovingly... he takes her face in his hands... kisses her soft, generous mouth...  35 thru\\tOMITTED 36  37   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)  Picard is still unconscious; more equipment is being set up by a MEDICAL TEAM including NURSE OGAWA and one other -- diagnostic apparatus, monitor, etc. Beverly hovers over Picard.  We name this child for a dear friend who died last year... but who will now live on through his namesake.  He\\'s starting life in the warmth of friends. Thank you. (re: long table) Please, help yourselves to something to eat.  As the audience of guests becomes just a homogeneous, relaxed group enjoying the fare on the long table, MUSIC from an unseen source begins playing.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - 3/24/92 - ACT THREE     33.  44 thru\\tOMITTED 47  48   PICARD & ELINE  as a female guest comes and takes the baby from Eline. She and Picard are now momentarily alone.  I remember. I was so nervous I thought I might drop her. (beat) Now look at her... a little lady...  (an admission) I\\'d always thought I didn\\'t need children to make my life complete... now, I can\\'t imagine life without them.  She gives him a warm smile and holds out her arms to him... they embrace lovingly.  49   VERY CLOSE ON ELINE  her face reflecting her silent, joyously contented knowledge of what he\\'s experiencing.  50   VERY CLOSE ON PICARD  Another long beat... Now, suddenly, his face changes to a surprised grimace of pain.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT THREE  34.  51   ANGLE  Eline Reacts to Picard\\'s expression of pain. And, as he GRUNTS in still further pain, and clutches his left arm:  Meribor... ?  She looks around and up. She has a great grin, reminiscent of her mother\\'s.  That\\'s my hobby; find your own.  And what has the scientist been up to today?  I haven\\'t reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn\\'t function by conjecture.  (beat) Tell me... why don\\'t you spend more time with that young fellow Dannick?  I\\'m not; I\\'m hypothesizing that he\\'s in love with you.  Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns... games and toys and clothes...  She smiles gently at him.  No... but it saddens me to see you bear the burden of knowing things... things you can\\'t change.  But I\\'m not sixteen. With my life ahead of me.  A beat, and then, pensively --  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 4/02/92 - ACT THREE  39.  62   CONTINUED: (3)  I can only say... (Beat) ... Live now, Meribor. Always make \"now\" the most precious time. \"Now\" will not come again.  Ah. Thank you, dear.  She moves toward him, and as he turns away to enter notes, she peers through the telescope.  Fine. Then maybe you\\'ll sit down and rest the way you\\'re supposed to.  He loves doing a lot of things -- too many. One week he wants to be a botanist, the next week a sculptor. I wish he could find some focus in his life.  (calling) Batai?  The MUSIC abruptly stops, and YOUNG BATAI, twenty, emerges from the house, carrying a flute.  I get the feeling from your mother that you have something to tell me.  Mother and son exchange quick glances.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT FOUR   43.  67   CONTINUED: (2)  Leaving school -- ? No, you\\'re not --  Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. A year before that it was botany. Now --  We\\'ll... we\\'ll discuss it.  Young Batai smiles, suspecting acquiescence.  If music is what he wants... why should I stand in his way? (beat) Who knows how much time he\\'ll have to follow any dream.  Eline watches as he flips through his journal.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 4/03/92 - ACT FOUR   44.  67   CONTINUED: (3)  Yes. (beat) It\\'s possible he\\'ll dismiss me from the Council.  The evidence is too pronounced. I can\\'t stay silent.  (brandishing journal) The facts are here. At least show them to someone who will recognize what they mean.  If you won\\'t take them, I most certainly will.  The Administrator suddenly realizes that they are speaking loudly, and have drawn a few curious looks. He lifts a warning hand to Picard, glances around, then, casually, begins to walk. Picard falls in line with him.  Surely the technology exists to save something of this world... perhaps some people could be evacuated...  A collection of genetic samples, then -- something, anything -- you can\\'t just let this civilization die --  What is it -- ?  Doctor -- ?  But the man simply shakes his head sadly.  (in kind) You always had a flair for the dramatic...  He didn\\'t have to. They already know.  (small smile) No...  She reaches up and touches his cheek lightly.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 4/03/92 - ACT FOUR       48.  73   CONTINUED:  I will.  And, without any indication that it\\'s happening, Eline is dead. Picard looks down at her for a long beat. Then he buries his head in the folds of her blanket.  FADE OUT. END OF ACT FOUR  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT FIVE       49.  ACT FIVE  FADE IN:  74   INT. MAIN BRIDGE  Picard, and all others, as we last saw them (with Beverly moving between her equipment and her patient) ...  74A  ON PICARD  Still unconscious, breathing evenly... his features composed and even.  74B  ANGLE - RIKER (OPTICAL)  A picture of frustration, pacing, staring out at the alien probe, stymied. Ogawa is studying the medical monitors.  You shouldn\\'t be out there for so long. It\\'s damaging, you know that.  Mmnph. (to Kamie) Do you wear your skin protector outdoors, young man?  Picard tickles him again, and the boy\\'s only answer is another spurt of giggling.  77   INCLUDING YOUNG BATAI  as he ENTERS. He\\'s now about thirty, and he wears a wide-brimmed hat, too.  What \"launching\"? What\\'s he talking about?  Are we, indeed. I\\'m not going anywhere to watch anything.  Meribor makes the mistake of moving to help her father off his knees. Picard, crustily independent, wrenches his arm away from her hand, and will make it (a bit creakily) to his feet on his own -- as Meribor smiles her affectionate understanding. Young Batai takes his nephew\\'s hand, and will lead him out after grabbing a hat for him, too.  (looking after them) Breaks my heart to look at him...  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - 3/24/92 - ACT FIVE         53.  77   CONTINUED: (2)  My grandson. Breaks my heart... he deserves a full rich life, and he\\'s not going to get one.  Meribor collects a hat for herself and for Picard; she puts her own on.  Why didn\\'t I hear anything about a launching?  78   OMITTED  79   EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY  Picard and Meribor walk together toward a group which has collected in the square, all looking toward the sky in one direction.  Did everyone know about this except me?  He sits down on a bench.  I can see all right from here.  She sits next to him. A beat, and then --  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 4/02/92 - ACT FIVE       54.  79   CONTINUED:  You go on with the others. Go hold onto my grandson, and watch the damned thing go up... for all the good it\\'ll do. What is it they\\'re launching?  Meribor turns to him. There is a knowing look in her eyes.  Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven\\'t seen any missile.  (in disbelief) Batai?  81   ANGLE ON BATAI  who approaches, looking as he did those many years ago.  STAR TREK: \"The Inner Light\" - REV. 3/27/93 - ACT FIVE       55.  81   CONTINUED:  A probe... that encounters someone...  The mists of recollection begin to part...  ... someone in the future...
